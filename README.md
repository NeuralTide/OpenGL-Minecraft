# Minecraft Clone

A Minecraft-inspired voxel game written in C++ using OpenGL, GLFW, and GLAD. This project aims to replicate the core mechanics of Minecraft while providing a platform for learning OpenGL and exploring advanced rendering techniques.<br />

Features:<br />
Voxel-based terrain generation and rendering<br />
Free-look camera<br />
Lighting and shading using OpenGL shaders<br />
Chunk system for efficient terrain management<br />

Roadmap:<br />
Implement collisions and player physics<br />
Implement biome generation (desert, forest, etc.)<br />
Add multiplayer support via networked servers<br />
Improve lighting with shadows and ambient occlusion<br />
Add dynamic weather and day-night cycle<br />
Create custom textures for different block types<br />
Implement inventory and crafting systems<br />
