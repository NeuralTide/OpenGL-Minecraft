# Minecraft Clone

A Minecraft-inspired voxel game written in C++ using OpenGL, GLFW, and GLAD. This project aims to replicate the core mechanics of Minecraft while providing a platform for learning OpenGL and exploring advanced rendering techniques.

#Features
Voxel-based terrain generation and rendering
Free-look camera
Lighting and shading using OpenGL shaders
Chunk system for efficient terrain management

#Roadmap
-Implement collisions and player physics
-Implement biome generation (desert, forest, etc.)
-Add multiplayer support via networked servers
-Improve lighting with shadows and ambient occlusion
-Add dynamic weather and day-night cycle
-Create custom textures for different block types
-Implement inventory and crafting systems

#Contributing
